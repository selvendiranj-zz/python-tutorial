Python Tuples
A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. 
A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, 
however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses.

The main differences between lists and tuples are: Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) 
and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) 
and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.

# For example âˆ’
tuple = ( 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2  )
tinytuple = (123, 'john')

print (tuple)             # Prints complete list
print (tuple[0])          # Prints first element of the list
print (tuple[1:3])        # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
print (tuple[2:])         # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print (tinytuple * 2)     # Prints list two times
print (tuple + tinytuple) # Prints concatenated lists

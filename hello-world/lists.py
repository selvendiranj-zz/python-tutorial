Python Lists
Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. 
A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). 
To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. 
One difference between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.

The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) 
with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. 

The plus (+) sign is the list concatenation operator, 
The asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.

# For example âˆ’
list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]
tinylist = [123, 'john']

print (list)            # Prints complete list
print (list[0])         # Prints first element of the list
print (list[1:3])       # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
print (list[2:])        # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print (tinylist * 2)    # Prints list two times
print (list + tinylist) # Prints concatenated lists

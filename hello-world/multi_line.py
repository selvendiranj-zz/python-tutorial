r"""
Statements in Python typically end with a new line. Python does, however,
allow the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue.
For example −
"""

total = item_one + \
        item_two + \
        item_three

# Statements contained within the [], {}, or () brackets do not need to use
# the line continuation character. For example −

days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday',
        'Thursday', 'Friday']
